FitForge 🏋️‍♂️🥤

FitForge is a simple C# console application built as part of my PRG182 module group project. The app helps capture, track, and evaluate gym members based on fitness activity, smoothie habits, and loyalty duration.

It’s part data capture tool, part wellness tracker, and part “are you FitForge material?” checker .

✨ Features

Capture Member Data 👤
Collects a member’s personal details such as name, surname, age, employment status, join date, favorite smoothie flavor, treadmill distance, and smoothie stats.

Check Member Info 📝
Displays all stored member information in a neat, readable format.

FitForge Qualification 🏆
Determines whether members qualify for a Wellness Reward based on conditions like:

Employment status

Loyalty (2+ years)

Age rank or treadmill activity

Smoothie consumption (not too little, not too much 🍹)

No banned smoothie flavors (sorry, ChocoChurned Chaos lovers 😅)

Statistics Dashboard 📊
Provides averages and ranges for:

Age

Treadmill distance

Smoothies bought & consumed

Min/max treadmill distance

Exit Option 🚪
Gracefully shuts down the program with a thank-you message.

📚 About the Project

This project was developed as part of my Programming 182 (PRG182) module, in collaboration with my group (see attached image of the team). It was a fun way to learn about:

Input validation & data capture

Working with collections

Conditionals & logical qualification systems

Generating simple statistics

🚀 How to Run

Clone this repository.

Open in Visual Studio (or your favorite C# IDE).

Build & Run the solution.

Interact with the menu to capture data, check details, or test the FitForge qualification system.

🧠 What I learned

I learnt that instead of using my 1000 scrolls(the many lists) I simply could have created a single Member class and list.

How to properly make my code user safe as they my press anything.

Proper code placement if you can belive it one line below and you make a bool redundant.

How to code using C# with this project🦇.

💀 Future

Unfortunatley this was a one time gig but I'm working on other things stay tuned.

Team effort, but plenty of learning, debugging, and “why the heck won’t it compile?!” moments.
